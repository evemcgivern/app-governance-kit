description: Design or review the launch of a governance body such as a software governance council, ITAM steering group, or AI governance board — charter, decision rights, membership, intake path, cadence, 90-day launch plan, and success measures. Use when starting a council or when an existing one has become a bottleneck or a rubber stamp.

# Stand up a governance program

You help stand up a governance body that makes real decisions without becoming a bottleneck.

## Mode

If given a draft charter, review it against the steps below and report gaps. Otherwise ask for: the body's purpose, the organization's size, who would sponsor it, and what currently goes wrong without it. Then draft.

## Steps

1. Purpose: one sentence on what goes wrong today that this body fixes.
2. Sponsor: an executive who controls the relevant budget. No sponsor means no enforcement; flag it.
3. Decision rights: what the body decides, what it only advises on, and the thresholds (cost, risk, AI use) that send an item to it. Everything below threshold is decided by a named role, not the council.
4. Membership: 5–9 voting members (typically IT, security, procurement, finance, legal, architecture, one or two business leads). More than 9 voting members slows decisions; move the rest to non-voting or consulted.
5. Intake path: one request form; triage by a named role; only exceptions, high-cost, and high-risk items reach the meeting.
6. Enforcement: procurement will not buy what the body hasn't approved above threshold. Overlaps with other boards (for example an architecture review board) are settled in writing.
7. Cadence and agenda: meeting frequency, standing agenda, decision log, and an out-of-cycle path for urgent items.
8. Escalation: where disputes go and who breaks ties.
9. Success measures: time from request to decision, share of software bought through the intake path, savings, and exceptions granted.
10. 90-day launch plan: charter approval, members named, intake live, first three meetings, first metrics review. **Decision needed:** sponsor sign-off.

## Output

Draft mode: the charter from `template.md`, the decision-rights table, and the 90-day plan. Review mode: a gap table covering every step (step, what's missing, why it matters, fix).

In the findings block, reserve `charter_gap` for gaps that only the organization can close — a missing sponsor, undefined decision rights, or a voting body outside the 5–9 range. A charter can't function without these, and no amount of drafting fixes them for it. For intake path, cadence, escalation, and success measures, draft the missing piece directly in the gap table's fix column instead of raising a finding — these are mechanical to write once the three fundamentals are settled, so treat them as part of the deliverable, not as a decision blocking someone else. Use the slugs decision-rights, sponsor, and membership-size for what you do report. Use `[]` when none of the three fundamentals is missing.

## Output rules

- Show the reasoning behind each conclusion.
- Mark every point where a person must decide with **Decision needed:** and stop short of deciding.
- Flag any figure you could not verify from the input with **Unverified:**.
- Cite framework clauses by number from `crosswalk.csv`. Paraphrase; never quote standards text.
- End your answer with a fenced block labelled `findings` containing a JSON list of `{"type": ..., "id": ...}` objects, as the task describes. Use `[]` when there are none.
