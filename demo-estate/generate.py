## Purpose
The council oversees software and applications at Halden Logistics.

## Members (voting)
CIO; CISO; heads of procurement, finance, legal, architecture, HR, operations, warehousing, transport, customer service, sales, marketing; and the service desk lead.

## Meetings
Monthly, 90 minutes. Standing agenda: new requests above threshold, exceptions, renewals due, and a review of measures. Outcomes are recorded in a register kept by the governance analyst. Urgent items are handled out of cycle by email vote within five working days.

## Scope
New software requests, renewals, retirements, and AI tools.

## Intake
Requests come through one software request form. The governance analyst triages requests weekly. Only items above a cost or risk threshold come to the council.

## Escalation
Disputes go to the Chief Operating Officer, who does not sit on the council and who breaks ties.

## Measures
Time from request to outcome, the share of software bought through the intake form, savings, and exceptions granted. Reviewed quarterly, starting from a baseline set in the first quarter.
